<h1>Done</h1>
<p>The cluster scoring for <tt>{{ token }}</tt> is done.
You can download the results here:
<br/><a href="/files/clusters/{{ token }}.csv">{{ token }}.clusters.csv</a>
</p>

<h2>Messages:</h2>

<pre>{{ messages }}</pre>

<h2>Survival</h2>
<p>
You can also upload survival data to do a survival analysis on the calculated clusters.
The file must meet the following requirements:
<ul>
<li>The first column is the sample id
<li>The second column is the followup time (as a number).
<li>The third column is the status at end of followup (0=no event, 1=event).
<li>The time is a number with no unit. Decimals are ok, using a dot.
<li>The fields are separated with tabs (\t).
<li>All sample ids in the survival file must also exist in the clustering result.
</ul>
<br/>You can download an example file <a href="/static/survival_example.txt">here</a>,
which should work with the example expression file. 
Like that file, this is synthetically generated, "fake", data.
