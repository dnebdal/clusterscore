<h1>Breast cancer immune clusters</h1>
<p>To use, upload a gene expression file; each sample in the file will be assigned to a cluster.</p>
<p>The file must meet the following requirements:<br/>
<ul>
<li>The first column is gene names.
<li>The rest of the columns are samples.
<li>The dataset must include all genes in the <a href="/static/geneset.txt">scoring set</a>, in any order.
<li>The fields are separated with tabs (&bsol;t).
</ul>
You can download an example file <a href="/static/expression_example.txt">here</a>. This file is "fake" - it has been synthetically generated to work as an example.
